title: about-me

<p>Since many years my greatest passion are software development and UI/UX design.<br>
I study <em>Media Management</em> in my last semester at <a href="http://www.hs-rm.de/" target="_blank">Hochschule RheinMain University</a> in Wiesbaden, Germany. I also held weekly official tutorings at this university for the subjects ICT and web technology for fellow students to prepare them for their exams. I did these tutorings for more than two years consecutively.
Next to my studies, I work at a software development firm which sells intranet software as well as plugins for it. Together with my team, I develop web-based software for our internal systems.
Mostly, I work with Python for the backend and JavaScript together with HTML/CSS for the frontend. The products are released as a rolling-release and therefore me and my team are developing new features alongside giving support for the products.<br>
Due to the fact that programming is also my favorite hobby, I work on a lot of open source projects in my free time which you can find on <a href="https://github.com/loehnertz" target="_blank">GitHub</a> or in my <a href="https://www.jakob.codes/#portfolio">portfolio</a> further down this page.
I enjoy working with these technologies the most, which does not mean that I hate other stacks of course: <em>Python</em>, <em>JavaScript</em> (as well as <em>TypeScript</em>), <em>Go</em>, <em>HTML</em> &amp; <em>(S)CSS</em>, <em>Node.js</em>, <em>Django</em>, <em>Express</em>, <em>Hapi</em>, <em>React</em>, <em>React Native</em>, <em>Angular</em>, <em>Vue.js</em>, <em>Electron</em>, <em>Firebase</em>, <em>Docker</em>.</p>
