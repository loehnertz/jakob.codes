title: about-me
---

<p>I was born and raised in Germany but I live in the Netherlands nowadays.<br>
Since many years my greatest passions are software development and UI/UX design.<br>
Therefore, I am currently a master student of <em>Software Engineering</em> at the <a href="http://www.uva.nl/" target="_blank">University of Amsterdam</a>. I held weekly official tutorings at my previous university in Germany for the subjects ICT and web technology for fellow students to prepare them for their exams. I did these tutorings for nearly three years consecutively.
Next to my studies, I work at a software development firm which sells intranet software as well as plugins for it. Together with my team, I develop web-based software for our internal systems.
Mostly, I work with Go and Python for the backend and Vue.js for the frontend. The products are released as rolling-releases, therefore my team and I are developing new features alongside giving support for the products.<br>
Due to the fact that programming is also my favorite hobby, I work on open source projects in my free time which you can find on <a href="https://github.com/loehnertz" target="_blank">GitHub</a> or in my <a href="https://www.jakob.codes/#portfolio">portfolio</a> further down this page.<br>
I enjoy working with these technologies the most, which does not mean that I hate other tech stacks: <em>Elixir</em>, <em>Python</em>, <em>Go</em>, <em>JavaScript</em> (as well as <em>TypeScript</em>), <em>Haskell</em>, <em>Vue.js</em>, <em>React (Native)</em>, <em>Node.js</em>, <em>Phoenix</em>, <em>Django</em>, <em>OTP</em>.</p>
