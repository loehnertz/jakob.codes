<p>This mobile application allows students enrolled in supported programs at Hochschule RheinMain University in Wiesbaden, Germany to check their timetables on the go.
I developed this app outside of university as a private project.
After it got much approval from professors though, I officially released it in the app stores of
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hsrmmedialabtimetableapp" target="_blank">Google</a> and  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hsrm-medialab-stundenplan/id1239076997" target="_blank">Apple</a> for free of course. The application is built upon <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/" target="_blank">React Native</a> and is licensed under the <a href="https://github.com/loehnertz/HSRMMedialabTimetableApp/blob/master/LICENSE" target="_blank">MIT-License</a>. Its open source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/loehnertz/HSRMMedialabTimetableApp" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
