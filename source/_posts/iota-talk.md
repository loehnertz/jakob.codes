<p>On the 2nd of March 2018, I held a public talk about the cryptocurrency <a href="http://iota.org/">IOTA</a> as part of a series of tech talks. The talk discusses the main aspects about IOTA in a technical manner as well as more practical use cases later on. I took care that the content is understandable regardless of the amount of prior knowledge about cryptocurrencies.
Additionally, I wrote an article on <a href="https://medium.com/@loehnertz/mit-der-kryptow%C3%A4hrung-iota-in-die-zukunft-der-maschinen%C3%B6konomie-88b96e972030">Medium</a> which summarizes the whole talk.
Both the talk and the article are in German though.</p>
