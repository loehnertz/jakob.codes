<p>Tanglestash is an algorithm I developed that allows it to persist any data onto the network of the cryptocurrency <a href="https://iota.org/" target="_blank">IOTA</a>. Of course, it can also retrieve data that was persisted with it beforehand.
For more info on the data structure I designed for it and for the general idea behind it, have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/loehnertz/Tanglestash/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">README on GitHub</a>. The module is licensed under <a href="https://github.com/loehnertz/Tanglestash/blob/master/LICENSE" target="_blank">MIT License</a> so it is entirely open source and also available on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/tanglestash" target="_blank">NPM</a>.
I also created a GUI for it which is also open source software and available for Windows, macOS and Linux. You can download the application from here: <a href="http://tanglesta.sh/" target="_blank">http://tanglesta.sh/</a></p>
