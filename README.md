# jakob.codes


## Motive

This is the source code of my personal website containing info about me, my portfolio and how to contact me!\
It's a static site generated with the static site generator [Hexo](https://hexo.io/).


## Plugin

In the context of the site I also developed a plugin for `Hexo` which adds custom fields to it.\
I published it on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hexo-custom-fields). You can also find the repository of it right [here](https://github.com/loehnertz/hexo-custom-fields).
